                      <p class="storyDos__text">(Told by Manu) I was out with a group of friends at a dive-y karaoke bar (please note that I do not under any circumstances sing karaoke) when I noticed a cute girl at a nearby table. I was just out of a relationship and not looking to meet anybody, but my very drunk friend decided to play matchmaker. She marched right over to the girl, told her I had a new puppy (true!) and that she should talk to me. We ended up talking all night, and when it was time to part ways, I realized my phone had died. Very excited, the girl applied some lipstick, kissed a cocktail napkin and wrote down her digits. And that would have been a very classy end to the evening…except that when I got home and plugged my phone in, I attempted to enter her number…and ended up butt dialing her three times at two in the morning. Luckily, she still called me back the next day, and the rest, as they say, is history</p>

                      <p class="storyDos__text">(Told by Sabri) We were wrapping up a date and were about to part ways at the subway station. Instead, we lingered for a bit and chatted. Finally, since I didn’t want to miss the last train, I said, “I’m ready when you are.” What I meant was, I’m ready to leave when you are. He misinterpreted my intention as, “I’m ready to kiss when you are.” So, he went for it!</p>

                      <p class="storyDos__text">Sabri was hosting an improv show at the summer camp where she was working when Manu decided to make a surprise appearance. With the help of another employee, he made his grand entrance to one of Sabri's favorite songs: "Single Ladies" by Beyoncé. In front of about 300 middle school kids, Manu presented her with a ring box he made with pages from "The Unbreakable Vow" chapter in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.</p>
